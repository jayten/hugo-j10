abstract = "The evolution of the primary vortex pair downstream of micro vortex generators placed in a supersonic stream is compared using a swirl center tracking technique, for standard, slotted, and split-ramp type vortex generators. Evolution of vortex strength, determined using circulation, and distribution of vortices, determined using contours of helicity, are also compared. Results show that secondary vortices emerge stronger, and lift-off rates drop, with the introduction of slot (slotted micro vortex generator) or gaps (split-ramp micro vortex generator). Near-surface contours of axial velocity, and integral properties of the boundary layer are then compared to evaluate the effects of the evolution of the vortical structures on the flow field. Results shows that the split-ramp device results in the most energetic near-surface flow, but the worst outgoing boundary-layer integral properties, while the slotted-ramp devices with taper fares well on both counts.   The computations performed in this work involve supersonic flow past single micro vortex generators at Mach 2.5, and uses an immersed-boundary method to render the control devices.  The flow solver is suitable for high-speed turbulent flows, and has been extensively validated in earlier works.  The turbulence model used is Menter’s k-ω/k-ε shear stress transport version."
