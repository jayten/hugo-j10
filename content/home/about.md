# Biography

 I am a direct Ph.D. student, pursuing my doctorate in the field of computational fluid dynamics under the guidance of [Dr. Santanu Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/iitmsghosh/home) in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering](http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/index.htm) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), Chennai. Part of my Ph.D. study involves the development of three-dimensional Navier-stokes solver for the structured grid using FORTRAN 90 (FEST3D). The aim of my work is to predict, accurately and effectively, the flow around a body using numerical methods. I have received a baccalaureate, B.Tech, in 2015, in the field of Mechanical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology (NIT) Kurukshetra](http://www.nitkkr.ac.in/).
