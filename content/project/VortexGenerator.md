Vortex generators have shown promise in reducing, if not completely removing, flow separation due to shock-boundary layer interaction. These devices introduce a set of co-rotating or counter-rotating vortex pairs into the flow, which are considered to make the streamwise velocity profile fuller (near the wall), effectively increasing the ability of the flow to withstand higher adverse pressure gradient without undergoing separation. A sub-class of vortex generators is the ramp-type or wedge-shaped vortex generator (other being vane type) that produces a counter-rotating vortex pair.

In the flow-field downstream of a ramp-type vortex-generator, as the counter-rotating vortex pair is advected by the mean flow, it is lifted off due to the mutual up wash. To an extent, the effectiveness of these vortices depends on how fast these vortices lift off, as vortices that lift off at a slower rate remain closer to the wall over longer distance downstream of the device trailing edge, and potentially have a greater energizing effect on the near wall flow. In this work, the evolution of the primary vortex pair downstream of vortex generators placed in a supersonic stream is compared using a swirl center tracking technique, for standard, slotted, and split-ramp type vortex generators.
